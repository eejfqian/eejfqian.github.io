This paper presents a **cascaded resonator decoupling network** that effectively suppresses inter-antenna coupling between filtering antennas operating in adjacent frequency bands.  
The approach preserves high in-band isolation and out-of-band selectivity, verified by prototype measurement results presented at **EuCAP 2024**.
