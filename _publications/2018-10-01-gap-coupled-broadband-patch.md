This work proposes an **electric–magnetic gap-coupled broadband antenna** integrating filtering and radiation in a unified structure.  
It achieves wider bandwidth and enhanced selectivity through structural control of electric and magnetic coupling modes.  
With over 100 citations, it marks a key step toward **fully integrated, multi-system MIMO architectures**.
