This paper proposes the **first systematic synthesis framework** for *transversal filtering antennas (TFAs)*, bridging classical coupling-matrix filter synthesis with radiating structures.  
It enables **precise control of radiation transmission zeros**, achieving both **in-band selectivity** and **out-of-band suppression**.

**Key Contributions**
- Established the theoretical foundation for transversal filtering antennas.  
- Developed synthesis procedures linking coupling matrices to antenna geometries.  
- Verified the theory through full-wave simulation and measurement, forming a **closed-loop validation**.
