The proposed transversal filtering IFA achieves high in-band selectivity and strong out-of-band suppression through transversal-mode interference.  
This paper proposes further extends the transversal filtering antenna concept to quarter-wavelength antenan designs. By using TFA structures in terminal antenna designs, the out-of-band isolation can be effectively suppressed. 
It demonstrates inherent port decoupling without additional circuits, offering a compact and efficient solution for terminal and array applications.

**Key Contributions**
- Extend the theoretical foundation for transversal filtering antennas.  
- Developed synthesis procedures for coupling-elements TFA with quarter-wavelength elements.  
- Verified the theory through full-wave simulation and measurement, forming a **closed-loop validation**.
