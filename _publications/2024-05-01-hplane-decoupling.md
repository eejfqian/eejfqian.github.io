This paper introduces an **H-plane electric–magnetic coupling cancellation** approach offering a simple and scalable in-band decoupling method.  
It achieves high isolation through intrinsic field interactions, providing a low-cost solution for compact arrays in multi-standard wireless systems.  
This concept is widely used in filter designs, Now we apply it to antenna decoupling. You will find some interesting results in this paper.
