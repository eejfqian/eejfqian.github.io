This paper proposes a **cascaded quadruplet filtering antenna** structure that realizes compact size and high selectivity through multi-resonator coupling.  
The approach provides an effective pathway for highly selective radiation responses in compact antenna modules, reported at **IEEE AP-S/URSI 2024**.
