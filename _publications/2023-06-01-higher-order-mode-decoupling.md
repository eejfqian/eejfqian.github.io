This work introduces a novel direction for the antenna decoupling. Instead of using commen fundamental modes, we achieved inherent high isolation among antennas by using the higher order modes of patch antennas. No extra decoupling structures are needed in this technology. This kind of technique is also known as self-decoupled antennas. 

**Key Contributions**
- Self-decoupling via higher-order modes, no extra decoupling structure needed. 
- Detailed design process provided.
- Measurement and simulation agree well.
