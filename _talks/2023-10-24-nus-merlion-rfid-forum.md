This invited seminar was part of the *Merlion RFID Forum 2023 Paper Sharing Series*, jointly organized by **IEEE Singapore RFID** and **ECE NUS**, hosted by **Professor Chen Zhi Ning**.  
The talk introduced a mode-control mechanism for **in-band decoupling between adjacent antennas**, demonstrating how higher-order modes can suppress mutual coupling without additional circuitry — improving stability and channel capacity in compact MIMO arrays.

**Host:** Prof. Chen Zhi Ning  
**Organizer:** IEEE Singapore RFID and ECE NUS  
**Venue:** Block E4, E4-04-05, E-cube 1, National University of Singapore  
**Time:** 3:30 PM – 4:30 PM, Tuesday, 24 October 2023
