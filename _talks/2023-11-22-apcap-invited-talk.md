This invited talk presented a **cascaded trisection (CT) filtering antenna** with a third-order filtering response and a controllable lower-band transmission zero (TZ).  
The work demonstrated how the CT structure enables **enhanced selectivity** and **improved out-of-band suppression** for compact filtering antennas.  
Measured and simulated results showed strong agreement, confirming the proposed synthesis concept.
