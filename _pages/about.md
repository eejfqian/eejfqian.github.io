I am Dr. Jianfeng Qian, a Research Fellow at the **Emerging Device Technology Laboratory, University of Birmingham (UK)**, working with **Prof. Yi Wang**.  
My research focuses on **FR3-band (7–24 GHz) hardware systems for 6G communications**, including **modular subarray architectures, high-selectivity filtering antennas, and advanced RF packaging**.

I received my **PhD in Electronic Engineering** from the **University of Kent**, supervised by **Prof. Steven Gao** and **Dr. Hanyang Wang**.  
Before that, I obtained my **M.E.** from **South China University of Technology (2019)** and **B.S.** from **Hefei University of Technology (2016)**.  
I also worked as an **SI/PI Engineer** at **HiSilicon (Huawei)** in Shanghai (2019–2020).

My research interests include:  
- Filtering and self-decoupling antennas for spectrum-compliant massive MIMO  
- Reconfigurable FR3-band subarrays and high-frequency RF packaging  
- 3D-printed and liquid-metal-integrated antenna structures  
- Thermal–electromagnetic co-design for reconfigurable front-ends  
I have published **over 19 journal papers**, including **9 first-author IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation** papers, several of which ranked among the *Most Read* in TAP.  
My works have also been presented at major conferences such as **EuCAP**, **AP-S**, and **UCMMT**.
