I am Dr. Jianfeng Qian, a Research Fellow at the **Emerging Device Technology Laboratory, University of Birmingham (UK)**, working with **Prof. Yi Wang**.  
My research focuses on **FR3-band (7–24 GHz) hardware systems for 6G communications**, including **novel phased array architectures, high-selectivity filtering antennas, antenna slef-interference cancellation, and advanced RF packaging**.

I received my **PhD in Electronic Engineering** from the **University of Kent**, supervised by **Prof. Steven Gao** and **Dr. Hanyang Wang**.  
Before that, I obtained my **M.E.** from **South China University of Technology (2019)** and **B.S.** from **Hefei University of Technology (2016)**.  
I also worked as an **SI/PI Engineer** at **HiSilicon (Huawei)** in Shanghai (2019–2020), and part-time Antenna/RF Engineer in Novocomms Ltd.

My research interests include:  
- Filters, Filtering Networks, and Filtering Antennas. 
- Phased Arrays.
- Antenna Decoupling.
- Antenna Integration.
- High-Frequency Interconnections.

I am also very interested in high-speed circuti design, 3D printed devices, and Antenna-in-Package. I have published **10 IEEE Trans**, including **9 first-author IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation** papers, several of which ranked among the *Most Read* in TAP.  
My works have also been presented at major conferences.
