**Role:** PhD Researcher (2020–2024)  
**Institution:** University of Kent, United Kingdom  
**Supervisors:** Prof. Steven Gao, Dr. Hanyang Wang  

This research systematically explores the **application of filtering antenna technology** to compact terminal antenna systems, aiming to improve both **spectral selectivity** and **mutual coupling suppression**.  

Key research outcomes include:
- Establishing a **unified synthesis method** linking coupling-matrix filters with radiating structures.  
- Developing **transversal filtering antennas (TFAs)** that provide controllable transmission zeros for out-of-band suppression.  
- Proposing **intrinsic decoupling mechanisms** between closely spaced antennas without extra circuits.  
- Demonstrating **prototype filtering–decoupling antennas** with high isolation and wideband in-band matching, verified experimentally.

The work provides theoretical and practical foundations for **integrated, spectrum-compliant multi-antenna systems** in future terminal and base-station designs.
